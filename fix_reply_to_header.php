This is a test of our FIXED outreach system! Now when you click Reply, it will go directly to the campaign owner's personal business email.<br><br>

<strong>WHAT'S DIFFERENT:</strong><br>
‚Ä¢ This email is sent FROM: $automationSender (automation system)<br>
‚Ä¢ But replies go TO: $campaignOwner (campaign owner's personal email)<br>
‚Ä¢ No more forwarding needed - direct communication!<br><br>

<strong>TEST INSTRUCTIONS:</strong><br>
1. Click REPLY to this email<br>
2. Your reply should automatically go to $campaignOwner<br>
3. No need to forward - you'll communicate directly!<br><br>

Please reply with 'Yes, this works!' to test the direct reply system.<br><br>

Best regards,<br>
